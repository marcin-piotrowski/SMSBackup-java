# SMSBackup-java
A simple app for backup your SMS. Messages are serialized into JSON, encrypted and storing on App Folder in Drive cloud.

The project was created for educational purposes, anyway if you have idea to improve this app let me know! :)

Main functionalities:
Backup - fetch all messages saved in cloud, compare with this on device and send difference to Drive
Restore - like backup but difference put into device DB
Mass erase - delete all SMS form device
